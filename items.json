Its seeds are ground into a fine, tasteless powder that suppresses male fertility. Men who want to avoid fathering children use this herb. A male humanoid who eats about a teaspoon of cassil is rendered infertile for a period of {@dice 3d4} days, although it requires about an hour before the herb takes effect. Stories abound of disloyal courtiers dosing their lords in order to prevent conception of an heir. Using either the Medicine or Nature skills, the effects can be detected with a DC 15 check and countered with a DC 20 check."

The woman can thereafter use the penis exactly as though she had one naturally, albeit with no chance of the woman impregnating another woman. The detachable penis does not cover the vagina and as such the woman can still be penetrated and impregnated as normal. The detachable penis can be detached by speaking the command word again; otherwise, it falls off after 1 hour has passed."

Placing 1 ounce of blood into the liquid causes it to, for lack of a better term, become pregnant, producing a single fetus, which takes as long to gestate as is normal for its race. A single person can use just his or her own blood to, in essence, produce a clone, although the baby has none of the memories or personality of its lone parent. Alternatively, two or more people can contribute blood to the artificial womb to produce a child that is a mix of all the contributors. In this way, a child can have more than two biological parents, and can even be the product of races that would normally be incompatible The Dungeon Master determines the specific race and sex of the resulting fetus, but it is otherwise always a perfectly normal and healthy example of its kind. Once the fetus has finished gestating, liquid inside of the artificial womb disappears (thereby ensuring that the new baby doesn’t drown). It reappears after 1 week, at which point the artificial womb can be used again"
